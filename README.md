# Crystal Collector

Crystal Collector is created using jQuery.

In Crystal Collector, the computer will generate a random number from 19 to 120 and provide it to the player. Each crystal pictured has its own randomly assigned value that is hidden from the player. When a crystal is clicked, the value is added to the "Total Score". The player must figure out the right combination of crystals to reach the computers randomly generated number. The player must get to the exact number without being under or going over in order to win. If guessed correctly, player wins. If incorrect, computer wins. A new game will start as soon as the current game finishes and a tally will be added to the "Wins" or "Losses" chart based on the result of the game.

# Directions

1. Open link in browser window (https://aancjr.github.io/Crystal-Collector/).
2. The computer has already picked it's number for you to reach.
3. Begin adding the crystals by clicking on your choice of crystals. (Note: Try to calculate the increase of your guess with each crystal click. This will help you reach the computer's guess accurately).
4. Click your choice of crystals until you have reached the computer's guess or have gone over.
5. The game will automatically end once you reach the score or go over and mark the result appropriately in "Wins" or "Losses". At the same time, the game will restart.
6. Play again!


This project is designed to become familiar with the jQuery language and to continue reinforcing the fundamental use of HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
